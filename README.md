# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the `pygame` library. The player controls the snake, which grows in length when it eats food. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen borders or itself.

## Features

- Control the snake using arrow keys
- The snake grows when it eats food
- Game over if the snake runs into itself or the screen borders
- Displays the player's score

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
UP arrow to move up
DOWN arrow to move down
LEFT arrow to move left
RIGHT arrow to move right
## How to Play
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by making the snake eat the food.
Each time the snake eats the food, it grows in length.
The game ends if the snake runs into the screen borders or itself.
After the game ends, you can press Q to quit or C to play again.
